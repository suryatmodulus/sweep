Modify each of the {n} snippets above according to the request using diffs.
* Keep whitespace and comments.
* Write minimal diff hunks to make changes to the snippets. Only write diffs for lines that should be changed.
* Write multiple small changes instead of a single large change.
* Use APPEND to add code after the snippet.
